# luigi
The plumber you'll hire to install all your Kubernetes network plumbing

Project Luigi is a new Kubernetes operator that allows our users to deploy multiple container network interface plugins. This is required for users who require near line speed network performance, such as 5G radio equipment and 5G Mobile Packet Core, and is also required for KubeVirt virtual machines that have more than a single network interface, as many production applications require.
